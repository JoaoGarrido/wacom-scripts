# Intro

A set of scripts to improve user experience of wacom tablets in Linux.

Tested in Linux Mint 20.04 but should work as long as the following packages are installed:
* xrandr
* xinput

Only tested with Wacom Intuos S using OpenTabletDriver.

To run the scripts run $chmod +x <name_of_the_script> before hand.

# map to screen

Maps the wacom tablet to a single screen.

Run the script: $./map_wacom_to_screen.sh
